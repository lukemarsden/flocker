ZFS on CoreOS
=============

This tutorial will show you how to get ZFS running on CoreOS using an experimental Gentoo prefix.

This is a just one of the prerequisites to getting Flocker_ working on CoreOS_, in order to be able to move stateful services in containers between nodes.

.. warning::

    This is a highly experimental proof-of-concept and should not be used for anything resembling production use cases.

The following instructions have been tested against CoreOS 423.0.0 (alpha) and CoreOS 367.1.0 (stable) and may or may not work against different versions.

Get a CoreOS cluster
====================

If you have not already, procure_ one or more CoreOS machines.

For this tutorial, we will just start up a single CoreOS VM using Vagrant_ on OSX::

    git clone https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant.git coreos-vagrant-zfs
    cd coreos-vagrant-zfs
    cp config.rb.sample config.rb
    vagrant up --provider=virtualbox

If you wish, you can perform the following setup on multiple nodes.

Download our ZFS environment
============================

Perform the following on each node to load the experimental ZFS kernel modules::

    # SSH to the node
    vagrant ssh core-01
    # Download our bits
<<<<<<< HEAD
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/experiments-clusterhq/zfs-coreos/coreos-gentoo-prefix-wip.tar.lz4.xz
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/experiments-clusterhq/zfs-coreos/liblz4.so.0.0
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/experiments-clusterhq/zfs-coreos/lz4c
    chmod +x lz4c
    chmod +x liblz4.so.0.0
    # Extract the tarball
    xzcat coreos-gentoo-prefix-wip.tar.lz4.xz | env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./lz4c -d | tar x
=======
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/experiments-clusterhq/zfs-coreos/coreos-gentoo-prefix-glibc-wip.tar.xz{.sig,}
    # Import public key from signing key pair from key server:
    gpg --recv-keys 'FD27D483' --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
    # Verify signature
    gpg --verify coreos-gentoo-prefix-glibc-wip.tar.xz{.sig,}
    # Extract the tarball
    tar xf coreos-gentoo-prefix-glibc-wip.tar.xz
>>>>>>> aa0236ba10eb77740e83f05295d2217fb33f4952
    # Enter Gentoo Prefix Shell
    gentoo/startprefix
    # Load modules
    sudo modprobe -v -d $HOME/gentoo zfs
    # Setup aliases
    alias zpool='sudo $(which zpool)'
    alias zfs='sudo $(which zfs)'

Now you should be able to test that basic ZFS commands work::

    core@core-01 ~ $ zpool status
    no pools available

Great!
We now have working ZFS support on this system, but no ZFS pools yet.

Create a ZFS pool
=================

The easiest way to do this is to create a ZFS pool in a file::

    sudo mkdir -p /opt/flocker
    sudo truncate --size 1G /opt/flocker/pool-vdev
    zpool create flocker /opt/flocker/pool-vdev

(For the adventurous who wants to try running ZFS on a real block device, try the following: shut down your VM, attach a new disk, boot the VM, log back in, run the commands ``gentoo/startprefix ...`` again, then run only the final command above, replacing ``/opt/flocker/pool-vdev`` with the block device of the new disk, e.g. ``/dev/sdb``.)

You can now inspect the state of the ZFS pool with ``zpool status``::

    core@core-01 ~ $ zpool status
      pool: hpool
     state: ONLINE
      scan: none requested
    config:

        NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        hpool       ONLINE       0     0     0
          sdb       ONLINE       0     0     0

    errors: No known data errors

You can now experiment with ZFS on CoreOS!

Deeper integration with Flocker_ is coming soon...

Additional documentation
========================
Information on how the tarball was created and how to rebuild the kernel
modules is located in `gentoo/NOTES` inside the tarball.

The licenses of all software included in the tarball are those under which it

released to the community under the licenses of the respective packages. The
tarball also includes all sources of compiled components, with the sole
exception being the absence of the kernel sources against which the ZFS kernel
modules were built. This is because the build procedure leaves them outside of
the `gentoo` directory. Information on how to obtain kernel sources for CoreOS
is included in the tarball's `gentoo/NOTES` file. All documentation written by
