Release Process
===============

Outcomes
--------

By the end of the release process we will have:

- a tag in version control
- a Python wheel in the `ClusterHQ package index <http://archive.clusterhq.com>`__
- Fedora 20 RPMs for software on the node and client
- documentation on `docs.clusterhq.com <https://docs.clusterhq.com>`__

If this is a major or minor release (i.e. not a weekly development release), we will also have:

- download links on https://clusterhq.com


Prerequisites
-------------

Software
~~~~~~~~

- Fedora 20 (``rpmbuild``, ``createrepo``, ``yumdownloader``) - it may be possible to install these on Ubuntu though.

  You are advised to perform the release from a :doc:`Flocker development machine <vagrant>` , which will have all the requisite software pre-installed.

- a web browser

- an up-to-date clone of the `Flocker repository <https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker.git>`_

- an up-to-date clone of the `homebrew-tap repository <https://github.com/ClusterHQ/homebrew-tap.git>`_

Access
~~~~~~

- A Read the Docs account (`registration <https://readthedocs.org/accounts/signup/>`__),
  with `maintainer access <https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/flocker/users/>`__ to the Flocker project.

- Access to `Google Cloud Storage`_ using `gsutil`_.


Preliminary Step: Pre-populating RPM Repository
-----------------------------------------------

.. warning:: This only needs to be done if the dependency packages for Flocker (i.e. ``geard`` and Python libraries) change; it should *not* be done every release.
             If you do run this you need to do it *before* running the release process above as it removes the ``flocker-cli`` etc. packages from the repository!

These steps must be performed from a machine with the ClusterHQ Copr repository installed.
You can either use the :doc:`Flocker development environment <vagrant>`
or install the Copr repository locally by running ``curl https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/tomprince/hybridlogic/repo/fedora-20-x86_64/tomprince-hybridlogic-fedora-20-x86_64.repo >/etc/yum.repos.d/hybridlogic.repo``

::

   mkdir repo
   yumdownloader --destdir=repo geard python-characteristic python-eliot python-idna python-netifaces python-service-identity python-treq python-twisted
   createrepo repo
   gsutil cp -a public-read -R repo gs://archive.clusterhq.com/fedora/20/x86_64


::

   mkdir srpm
   yumdownloader --destdir=srpm --source geard python-characteristic python-eliot python-idna python-netifaces python-service-identity python-treq python-twisted
   createrepo srpm
   gsutil cp -a public-read -R srpm gs://archive.clusterhq.com/fedora/20/SRPMS


Preparing for a release
-----------------------

#. Choose a version number:

   - Release numbers should be of the form x.y.z e.g.:

     .. code-block:: console

        export VERSION=0.1.2

#. File a ticket:

   #. Set the title to "Release flocker $VERSION"
   #. Assign it to yourself

#. Create a clean, local working copy of Flocker with no modifications:

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone git@github.com:ClusterHQ/flocker.git "flocker-${VERSION}"

#. Create a branch for the release and push it to GitHub:

   .. code-block:: console

      git checkout -b release/flocker-${VERSION} origin/master
      git push origin --set-upstream release/flocker-${VERSION}

#. Update the version numbers in:

   - `docs/gettingstarted/linux-install.sh <https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker/blob/master/docs/gettingstarted/linux-install.sh>`_ and
   - `docs/gettingstarted/tutorial/Vagrantfile <https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker/blob/master/docs/gettingstarted/tutorial/Vagrantfile>`_
   - `docs/gettingstarted/installation.rst <https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker/blob/master/docs/gettingstarted/installation.rst>`_ (including the sample command output)
   - Commit the changes:

     .. code-block:: console

        git commit -am "Bumped version numbers"

#. Ensure the release notes in :file:`NEWS` are up-to-date:

   XXX: Process to be decided.
   See https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker/issues/523

     .. code-block:: console

        git commit -am "Updated NEWS"

#. Ensure copyright dates in :file:`LICENSE` are up-to-date:

   XXX: Process to be decided.
   See https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker/issues/525

     .. code-block:: console

        git commit -am "Updated copyright"

#. Push the changes:

     .. code-block:: console

        git push

#. Ensure all the tests pass on BuildBot:

   Go to the `BuildBot web status`_ and force a build on the just-created branch.

#. Do the acceptance tests:

   XXX: See https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker/issues/315


Release
-------

#. Change your working directory to be the Flocker release branch working directory.

#. Create (if necessary) and activate the Flocker release virtual environment:

   .. code-block:: console

      mkvirtualenv flocker-release-${VERSION}
      pip install --editable .[release]

   .. note:: The example above uses `virtualenvwrapper`_ but you can use `virtualenv`_ directly if you prefer.

#. Tag the version being released:

   .. code-block:: console

      git tag --annotate "${VERSION}" "release/flocker-${VERSION}" -m "Tag version ${VERSION}"
      git push origin "${VERSION}"

#. Go to the `BuildBot web status`_ and force a build on the tag.

   .. note:: We force a build on the tag as well as the branch because the RPMs built before pushing the tag won't have the right version.
             Also, the RPM upload script currently expects the RPMs to be built from the tag, rather than the branch.

   You force a build on a tag by putting the tag name into the branch box (without any prefix).

#. Set up ``gsutil`` authentication by following the instructions from the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ gsutil config

#. Build python packages and upload them to ``archive.clusterhq.com``

   .. code-block:: console

      python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
      gsutil cp -a public-read \
          "dist/Flocker-${VERSION}.tar.gz" \
          "dist/Flocker-${VERSION}-py2-none-any.whl" \
          gs://archive.clusterhq.com/downloads/flocker/


#. Build RPM packages and upload them to ``archive.clusterhq.com``

   .. code-block:: console

      admin/upload-rpms "${VERSION}"

#. Build tagged docs at Read the Docs:

   #. Go to the Read the Docs `dashboard <https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/flocker/versions/>`_.
   #. Enable the version being released.
   #. Wait for the documentation to build.
      The documentation will be visible at http://docs.clusterhq.com/en/${VERSION} when it has been built.
   #. Set the default version to that version.

      .. warning:: Skip this step for weekly releases and pre-releases.
                   The features and documentation in weekly releases and pre-releases may not be complete and may not have been tested.
                   We want new users' first experience with Flocker to be as smooth as possible so we direct them to the tutorial for the last stable release.
                   Other users choose to try the weekly releases, by clicking on the latest weekly version in the ReadTheDocs version panel.

   #. Force Read the Docs to reload the repository, in case the GitHub webhook fails, by running:

      .. code-block:: console

         curl -X POST http://readthedocs.org/build/flocker

#. Update the Homebrew recipe

   The aim of this step is to provide a version specific ``homebrew`` recipe for each release.

   - Checkout the `homebrew-tap`_ repository.

     .. code-block:: console

        git clone git@github.com:ClusterHQ/homebrew-tap.git

   - Create a release branch

     .. code-block:: console

        git checkout -b release/flocker-${VERSION%pre*} origin/master
        git push origin --set-upstream release/flocker-${VERSION%pre*}

   - Create a ``flocker-{VERSION}.rb`` file

     Copy the last recipe file and rename it for this release.

   - Update recipe file

     - Update the version number

       The version number is included in the class name with all dots and dashes removed.
       e.g. ``class Flocker012 < Formula`` for Flocker-0.1.2

     - Update the ``sha1`` checksum.

       .. code-block:: console

          sha1sum "dist/Flocker-${VERSION}.tar.gz"
          ed03a154c2fdcd19eca471c0e22925cf0d3925fb  dist/Flocker-0.1.2.tar.gz

     - Commit the changes and push

       .. code-block:: console

          git commit -am "Bumped version number and checksum in homebrew recipe"
          git push

   - Test the new recipe on OS X with `Homebrew`_ installed

     Try installing the new recipe directly from a GitHub link

     .. code-block:: console

        brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClusterHQ/homebrew-tap/release/flocker-${VERSION}/flocker.rb

   - Make a pull request

     Make a `homebrew-tap`_ pull request for the release branch against ``master``, with a ``Refs #123`` line in the description referring to the release issue that it resolves.

#. Make a pull request on GitHub for the release branch against ``master``, with a ``Fixes #123`` line in the description referring to the release issue that it resolves.
