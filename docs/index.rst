Flocker Documentation
=====================

Flocker is a data volume manager and multi-host Docker cluster management tool.
With it you can control your data using the same tools you use for your stateless applications.
This means that you can run your databases, queues and key-value stores in Docker and move them around as easily as the rest of your app.

With Flocker's command line tools and a simple configuration language, you can deploy your Docker-based applications onto one or more hosts.
Once deployed, your applications will have access to the volumes you have configured for them.
Those volumes will follow your containers when you use Flocker to move them between different hosts in your Flocker cluster.
